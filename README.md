## Overview
Dynamic Sum is a C++ application that allows users to input as many integers as wanted.
The program dynamically stores these integers in an array and calculates the sum of all entered numbers. 

## Features
- Accepts user input until `0` is entered to terminate input.
- Dynamically resizes the array to accommodate more numbers.
- Calculates and displays the sum of all entered numbers.
- Prints the list of entered numbers.

## Files Included
- **main.cpp**
- **getAnswers.hpp/.cpp**: Functions to collect user input.
- **sum.hpp/.cpp**: Functions to calculate the sum of the numbers.
- **printArray.hpp/.cpp**: Functions to print the array of numbers.
- **expand.hpp/.cpp**: Functions to dynamically expand the array.
- **myGlobalVariable.hpp/.cpp**: Header and implementation for the global variable managing the number of inputs.

## How To Use:
Follow the prompt to enter integers. Enter 0 to stop inputting numbers.
The program will then print all entered numbers and the sum it all up!
